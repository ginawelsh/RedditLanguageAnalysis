I was in a top 50 guild in classic and it was a big one and we had like 20-30 officers with different degrees of authority in three tiers. Top tier were raid leads  second tier were class leads, and bottom tier officers were just mainly moderators or external affairs like the YouTube channel or like a PR officer.I don't think she's part of the standing DNC committee anymore.   Sorry my original comment was confusing.   She is still a Dem House Representative for  Florida.

I do believe that when delegates are selected in each party at that time or right after that, the standing committees are formed and their representatives selected.

There are three standing committees.  Credentials, Platform and Rules with a total of 187 members for all three committees.   Those are all selected and voted for at the state level. 

Then you have the Party Leader and Elected Official committee. These 25 members are nominated by the Elected Official Chairperson of the DNC.

NPR typically leans left and for them to be spouting this suggests that the neoliberals are trying to mislead the centrists to cover up the issue until the progressives get sick enough, hungry enough, or homeless enough that they're forced back to work.No a pragmatist, Bush did it, Obama did it, Trump did it, Biden will too.

Of course if its a toxic family then its gonna suck, regardless of where in the world.and thats just life sometimes.Whats been pretty revealing for me personally is that I was a manager and was the one trying to keep the machine going. It almost ripped my family apart because I worked so hard, so often basically hustling to keep guys happy or weed out the bad ones and constantly try to find new ones that are capable. I got paid much better than the guys under me and I can understand why their attitude was FUCK IT. I use to go hard for my employer because I thought it would get me somewhere.

Does the nonprofit sell the food you cook?Both my parents are teachers, my gf is a teacher, my brother is a teacher. I know what I am talking about, I have analyzed their contracts. Most teachers work way more than are contractually obligated and I think they should do a working strike and only fulfill the hours in the contract. It would be like an hourly office worker doing a ton off work off the clock and then saying they don’t make enough for how much they work; like no fuck that do what you are paid for no more, no less. Adjusted for time off, teachers are paid well.Are we striking?!?!!? Let's do this. Universal Health Care and a Living Wage!WrongYour talking about 3 states that all couldn’t be any further apart from each other. Where in Florida are you muscled out on a low 6 figure salary? My wife and I are in that range and are building a brand new 4/3/3 2600sf house right now with tons of upgrades for 440k. That’s very attainable on a 6 figure salary. If your debt free and make that kind of money you can afford a 500k house. That aside housing is ridiculously expensive but unless you want a house in downtown Miami or a swanky area of a city you can easily buy a house in Florida on that salary.They are the assimilated enemy of the working class, just like the cops and politicians. Rather than stand up for a better way of life, they've embraced the corrupt, morally bankrupt and rigged system. They will fight you if you try to share the true reality of the situation, having embraced the propaganda and the struggle unable to conceive and wrap their mind around the fact there are other ways to live.

My family is among them and despite what I have tried, they can't be reasoned with. They cannot be brought to our side via intelligent discourse. It will take a soul crushing event where the system casts them out and into the gutter before they are able to see what is happening. Losing their job, marriage, family, house, car, etc through no fault of their own, and the system uncaringly moving on while they are left in a ditch, homeless and alone before they come to terms with reality.

They are the enemy, and must be treated as so in the near future. You can't share your thoughts, burdens, plans with them as they will turn you in. It's important to remember this, they will 100% bury you in order to progress in this corrupt society.>However, I'd love to see them try to use it once I'm gone.

This is more than enough.

You don't need to do anything that could get you in legal trouble. The simple fact of being the creator and not being there to train your replacement will be more than enough.

It’s a bigger issue then let’s just all not go into work until they give in, people need to be prepared for an extended period of time where no food or services will be available because we can’t just have one company or one industry or workers go on strike we’d need to all do it at the same time, that means factories are empty, no trucks delivering produce of all kinds, no grocery stores no gyms no restaurants no fast food no convenience stores no nothing. 
 I would love for us to come together and demand more for ourselves and future generations so that life isn’t all about making profits we’ll never get to see but I highly doubt that we are ready to do what it takes and  have to probably suffer for a period of time where people would just give up before seeing any real change.

Now find a new job because fuck that asshole!Same boat - but now I live somewhere where houses aren’t seen as an investment - they are a depreciating asset like a car or any other product. Houses begin (on the whole) losing value the second you move in. I used to think it was a joke but now I am coming around to see the value in it. It also makes renting less of a suckers game, because while buying is cheaper in the long run it isn’t such a massive difference that you feel you’re missing out on an investment as a renter, you are more choosing flexibility and lower responsibility for a slightly higher cost.Yeah that was literally my point dumbass.You’re a gas lighting Moron… sorry you can’t understand basic math or statistics… you should take some statistics classes, or basic math for that matter… 😂Happy to help.

https://www.thewindowsclubi.com/Scrolling through your profile, it looks like you actually don't agree with the idea.  What is one possible proposed solution to the current pay disparity that you believe could possibly be a solution?I think you need to realize that over 70% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. People can’t even save for retirement and pay off debt let alone yolo money into Tesla. I am just starting to actually turn a profit after 5 long years of being in the workforce because I didn’t have mommy and daddy to fund a college education and had to scrap for every cent I had to give myself the opportunity I have today. With how hard I have worked I should have a years salary saved by now and be considering the prospect of purchasing a home. Instead I’m just now beginning to be able to save for retirement and am starring up at a modest $24000 in student debt that, if we are following a hierarchy of needs, should be paid off before considering a brokerage account for individual stocks. I consider myself lucky btw. Your take is actually one of the stupidest, out of touch takes I have ever seen as someone who is an IAR for FINRA member firm. If I could downvote you 306,000,000,000 times I actually would just to put Elon’s absurdly dumb wealth into perspective for you. 

This response isn’t even meant to be a sob story because I’m totally proud of what I’ve accomplished and what others have been able to do in similar shoes. This response is here just to tell you how fiscally idiotic that take is. The wealth isn’t being redistributed through stock market gains because those same gains that the average shareholder enjoys are also enjoyed tenfold by billionaires. If Elon invests $1,000,000,000 (.32% of his net worth) in Tesla and gets a 100% gain on it he now has $2bn. The median net worth in the US is a measly $121,000. If that same person takes their full net worth to tesla and gets that same 100% gain, they have $242,000. 

Tell me more about how you think the wealth is being redistributed.We are most certainly *not* all AmericansThis is why I give hand jobs in back alleys. I know I am supposed to report my illegal activity’s as income, but for what it takes of my soul, I’d say it is a complete deduction.We have this same rule. Makes no sense.No. This suggests you actually have a chance. If you didn’t have money you literally can’t win."I'm an architect.   Have you ever see the Guggenheim?"is that possible 😳I’m aware of his history. And if you don’t think landing a $200,000,000 contract involves luck, then you’re the same sucker he’s talking to. Hard work does not equal success. Hard work equals increasing your luck. Not saying don’t work hard, I’m saying his ethos here is bull shit because MAYBE 0.01% of people that work hard will strike this kind of notariety and or wealth.Damn you were right. That’s wild. 
I’ll never understand why anyone would ever want to go to NYC, let alone live thereThey want me to go from an hourly union worker to salary. 25% decrease not to mention benefits and benefits. I can’t wait to find out how much I get paid per year and slap them across the head with their petty offer. It’s insulting how much and how hard I work to be offered such a low base salary. Food, cost of living and inflation are all sky rockets but you should roll back cause your above average salary. You work as hard as Timmy next to you who plays on his phone all day. Puke.  

Back to the tools I go so I can make the wages I deserve. I owe I owe I owe. 

Your replaceable unless you own the company…At a company I used to work for they would try to pull this stunt. They’d give you three shirts to wear when you started, would’ve been nice to get enough to last the week, and we had to buy any after that. I would always wear my shirts down to rags. If ever I was asked why I don’t buy new shirts I would tell them that I refuse to be extorted. That would usually get a laugh. After a couple weeks they would tell me that I need to buy new shirts. That’s when I would say that I will not be extorted and if they’re worried about it they can get me some new ones. Lucky for me, that always worked and I would always get new shirts.Imagine thinking that anyone is capable of making that much money by hard work or clever risks, assuming that you are a muskrat, did you know that Elon didn’t make PayPal, he merged a company with one that he already owned and changed the name so people would google who made PayPal and see his name. Elon did not make his wealth through seeing a vision and acting upon it he made his wealth by exploiting workers and buying other peoples product

It doesn't, but he didn't acquire wealth either.

Most stocks went up due to inflation, and the relative wealth gain is zero when stocks rise from inflation.

In terms for the borderline illiterate, if $10 is worth today what $5 was yesterday, and today you have $10 and yesterday you had $5, you gained no wealth, despite doubling your net worth.

They think it’s one guy in the company taking it in but the reality is shipping companies have cause a lot of these increases. At least in the industry I am in.

And the problem is people “can’t get their shit off” faster because of the backlogs. Nobody chooses to let it sit there. Yet they like on the “penalties” for a situation the person paying has ZERO control over.

Just going on a strike without clear demands won't exactly accomplish much.  Also, we need someone to hold accountable for the change.  They could pass a law giving us what we demanded, then a month later begin repealing it.But they want to spend the least amount of money possible. Typical.I wonder the results of this... These places end up paying more (ultimate goal) and owners making less so less incentive to open your own business... Then with less businesses people will have less choice for jobs (dead end as they may be)... So then people will end up forced to work at a place paying shit wages again?I actually had very good history teachers in school. I just wasn't interested in it.

Something that remains with me until today was that British couldn't sell their shit to Europe and tried offloading stuff in Brazil. Things like skis and sleighs. In Brazil. 

Our winter barely goes close to 3C in the coldest regions.It is when I'm planning to leave alongside the other people holding this place together as a 'fuck you' to management.A Boomer certainly didn't write this. They contracted it out to a millennial for a per word rate that translates to approximately minimum wage.The sheer amount of money that just gets moved around to make more of itself is why I literally can't take seriously the "value" of money and have a hard time working. The reward structure is busted in my brain

I can make or lose life-changing amounts of money by fucking pressing buttons on my phone like how does anything make sense anymoreWent to the last open 5 guys near me today.

Closed with only 2 employees doing online orders only, it seems all the rest are out sick with COVID-19.No. Its not. You all need to plan strikes months and months in advance.

You need union support and mutual aid organizations set up *prior to walking off and downing your tools.*They already know their job sucks. You’ll struggle to convince them that losing their job for a 9 day strike is going to help them. 

I’m not saying it’s impossible, but most people living paycheck to paycheck don’t wanna risk it.Did he died?Have you talked to a venezuelan though? There's vast information on how the government hasn't allowed them to choose their path; and how they took a prosperous nation into ruins. It's not propaganda, it was bad management. 

Also, an elected leader by whom? There's substantial evidence that their elections are manipulated. On top of that, the party in power owns all levels of government branches; count the military too that protects them and not the people.

I can tell that you believe in fairness. How do you find the Venezuelan example fair after taking all the fact in?

It was hard finding substitute teacher workMy serious but not so fun answer: America is really big and none of us have any connection to the vast majority of other Americans. 

MLK didn't organize by getting people to share Facebook events and hoping it worked out. MLK knew community leaders (NAACP reps, pastors, deacons, etc.) who in turn knew the people who would be taking part in their movements. They knew these people's families, they knew what was at stake for them on a personal level, and they were part of their community. MLK had centralized leadership, shot callers who spoke for the movement and who could point to specific legislation that they wanted to see passed. 

This sub has none of that. No leaders, no formal organization, no concrete goals, no connections the the hundreds of millions of people that are expected to take part in this general strike. Most people don't even know this sub exists, how can antiwork claim to speak for them?How the fuck do Guild Leaders even manage a guild?Most people would say: “Eat shit” but you went out like a pro as if it were a piece of cake.

I 100% support fair pay and good treatment at work, but I have been curious.Because wealth generation becomes an all consuming metric on which to judge each other in a late-stage Capitalist dystopia.  People with low paying jobs are seen as failures within such a system, ignoring the fact that low-paid work is going to make up the vast majority of work on offer.  People make the assumption that people in low paid work have done very little to compete with when up against the ability to pay out-right for education if your family is wealthy enough, or have the social ties to get a foot in the door within the corporate world.So the solution is to move out of America.

Cool. It still has fuck all to do with the context of this discussion, you stooge.LFG!!!!

If you have to seriously decide between finding another job and stealing from a shitty employer you have real moral issues or a lack of them

You're making it sound like a strike would be difficult to organize but there is plenty of precedence for successful nation wide strikesYep.

You can show support for essential grocery workers by signing [this](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/support-essential-grocery-workers) petition in support of the King Soopers (Kroger) employees striking in Colorado.

The CDC and Facui only want the best for us. /sAgain, hear me out. I appreciate the fact that we do not need to agree to be on the same side of this.

I am a huge fan of trying something different to see what happens, and I wholeheartedly admit when my plans have been tried and failed.

Protests have been tried. I can't give you statistics on what percentage have failed. Do statistics exist for what happens if we stay at home?  

The truth is that the powers that be have a playbook for what to do when we protest, and they've been improving their technique for decades. If we refuse to incite violence or break the law, they send in some agents who incite violence and break the law. We take the blame.

They don't have a plan to combat what I am suggesting. Not yet. If, at some point, they decide to write a law saying we can be forced to work then our movement will only get stronger. 

If a soldier points a gun at me and tells me to run a machine, I'll lose my arm to it without breaking eye contact.

Simply as "you can't just make a discord group/subreddit and expect a nation-wide strike to happen". the million man march took over a year of planning between dozens of chapters of the NAACP. 

To be blunt, reddit has the attention span of a goldfish. That's why it can be so difficult to organize "internet strikes".

Nothing has ACTUALLY changed. Minimum wage should be $15-25. Period. We havent one until we are in that range, with promises of yearly increases due to inflation and living costs.The monopoly money they just printed every year. We all know where the money comes from. But where does the purchasing power come from? Your pay check. They spend that money once and the value of your paycheck is diminished a little forever. Then the next year they do it again.This robbed the unions of so much power and the ability to fight in the 80's when they needed to.  If they found solidarity with the civil rights movements, NOW, migrant strikes, etc. they would've had a true base to stand up to Reagan and all the other hits unions have taken.  Solidarity between struggles is endlessly important.I love this sub but this is probably the stupidest post I've seen on here and I would consider myself a stoner. I don't think people need to be high to realize the corporate corruption going on around us and how much the working class is being exploited. Anyone can see that we are being taken advantage of if you look past the propaganda that is instilled in us since childhood. Also as others have pointed out weed was made illegal as a way to target minorities.They have normal stuff, too.I am immediately grateful I don’t know who made this signit’s not just talk, it’s people being genuinely scared of losing work and already struggling going paycheck to paycheck, it’s the fear the corporate bastards have put in our heads for centuries, if we do this then we’re doing it for the rights of all workersDon't they lose money for shipping stuff?This is true, but it's the result of bullshit. Labor unions are not an inherently left wing thing. Conservatives hate unions because management has spent 40 years, and countless dollars, telling them unions are bad. On a personal level anyone with even a hint of empathy will usually support a walk out. Regardless of political ideology people tend to like those who stand up to bullies.Yes. This is a "people who make the decisions don't see any downside" thing. They only notice when the whole system breaks down utterly.I agree. But setting up a "all or nothing so we can only do nothing" doesn't help any of these issues either. Tax reform is always possible and it doesn't have to be punative.

Eventually an app or something appears idkTermination is a formal procedure. With no firing, resignation, both of which should be accompanied by a letter or SOME writing, or a contract codicil stating that behavior initiates termination proceedings, it’s just an unexcused absence. It’s not followed in the ground pounding industries, where I believe some managers believe you must apply for a resignation (permission to quit), but it’s law.Someone make a Facebook event and lets call it a day.It's such a scam. They said this shit would be fun, but I'm only in my 20s and already exhausted, lmao.I had an ER nurse accuse me of being on drugs and neglecting my children while I was having 2 seizures that landed me in the ER. She told the same thing to the doctor who saw me too, so he heavily questioned me about drug use and told me to just come clean so they could treat me. I finally got pissed at them both and demanded a drug test. Negative, just like I told them. No apologies, just an IV and a "don't know what's wrong with you, go see you regular doctor".

Being underage I only made 5.90 an hour in a 90 day probationary period and had to pay off a $190 dollar jacket. Was only paid during lessons and maybe got one or two a shift 3 days a week. it took me like 6 weeks to pay the jacket off before I got any pay. I also bought my season pass and wasn’t reimbursed to the end of the season and paid $259 dollars for that up front.To be fair, this entire subreddit likes to ignore the fact that business owners had to front and put at risk a sum of money to create the business and job that you are now complaining about.

The argument shouldn't be against profits.  Business owners deserve to be rewarded for their initial investment.

The argument should be for more fairness towards the workers in regards to these profits.

If you cannot keep your business running without unethically taking advantage of the working class vis-a-vis paying them an unliveable wage, then your business model shouldn't be used to begin with.You're getting down votes because you sound like a jackass rubbing peoples noses in your material successIt’s not wrong for you to quit your job for any reason you want.

This may offer a mental health break for us working in hospitals, and trust me I could use one, but it results in death for others who are innocent in all of thisThey are saying that when the Cares Act was passed the unemployment rate was approaching 15% and the fear was that the lock down and increased unemployment would stall the economy which is why they stimulated it. 

Today, unemployment is low and we are experiencing semi rapid inflation. 

Hence, we probably shouldn’t stimulate the economy right now as doing so will require an increase in unemployment to stop the inflation. 

The good news is that it looks like wages are finally rising after +20y of low en employment.  It should also be mentioned that the stimulus was meant to increase spending NOT provide income for the unemployed. That was handled through the enhanced unemployment program.Same

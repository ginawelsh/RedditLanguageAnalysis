# Reddit Language Analysis

This project looks at four (polarisingly chosen) subreddits and aims explore several questions related to the language used in these subreddits.

The chosen subreddits are /r/antiwork, /r/productivity, /r/skeptic and /r/psychic. I will be drawing data primarily from comments posted in these communities (obtained using the PRAW Python API) and using the NLTK tool to analyse the comments.

So far in this project:

- I have explored frequency distributions of words (e.g. What are the top 20 nouns, verbs and adjectives of each subreddit?)

In the future, I would like to:

- Make forays into language generation using n-grams (my first time doing this)

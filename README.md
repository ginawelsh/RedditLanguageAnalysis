# Reddit Language Analysis

This project looks at four (polarisingly chosen) subreddits and aims to analyse the language of their comments.

The chosen subreddits are /r/antiwork, /r/productivity, /r/skeptic and /r/psychic.

In this project, I will be exploring frequency distributions of words (e.g. What are the top 20 nouns, verbs and adjectives of each subreddit) and I will also be making forays into comment generation using n-grams (my first time doing this)
